# LU Decomposition without zero on the diagonal

## AIM:
To write a program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
### 1. To Find L and U matrices with LU Decomposition
1. Get the matrix from the user.
2. Using "from scipy.linalg import lu" to import scipy (LU) module.
3. Using "L,U=lu(a)" we can get the matrix of L and U.
4. Print the result matrices (L and U Matrices).
5. End of the Program.

## Program:
```
/*

```

## Output:
![lu decomposition]()


## Result:
Thus the program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix is written and verified using python programming.
